</div>
            <h1>Relationship Between Cost Ratio and Thresholds</h1>
<p>The <em>ROC Curve</em>, one of the most used and recognized graphs to compare classifier performances, provides insight on how performant a model is in predicting classes. By evaluating the true positive and false positives rates across different threshold values, the <em>ROC Curve</em> serves as a useful diagnostic tool in deciding which threshold value to use at inference time.</p>
<p>However, one of the shortcomings of the <em>ROC Curve</em> is that it assumes equal costs for both false negatives and false positives. There can be scenarios where a model missing a positive label is worse than incorrectly classifying an example as a negative label. This is particularly an issue for imbalanced classification problems where the number of datapoints for each label is not balanced to begin with. As such, because the <em>ROC Curve</em> uses the assumption of equal costs for all misclassified instances, its result cannot be generalized across all outcomes.</p>
<div class="mdl-cell info-box mdl-cell--12-col mdl-cell--6-col-tablet mdl-cell--4-col-phone">
  <div class="info-box-title">Desirable Trade-Offs</div>
  <div class="info-box-text">
It is important to understand the context behind each outcome generated by your model. Doing so will help guide you in deciding how to choose the best classifier for your task.
<p>For example, perhaps you are working on a model that uses data acquired from several tests to help determine if a patient who was just admitted into a hospital should be placed in an intensive care unit (ICU) or not. Now, if a patient who needs to be placed in ICU is instead placed in a regular room (in other words, a <strong>false negative</strong>), then this may endanger their life. On the other hand, if a patient who does not need to be assigned to the ICU gets assigned to one (in other words, a <strong>false positive</strong>), then this may cause a large unnecessary expense to the patient.</p>
<p>In this example, depending on the reason why a patient was admitted into a hospital, you could argue that a false negative is worse and more costly than a false positive.</p>
<p>In your work, make sure that you make a responsible decision about the tradeoffs between false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. You may want a very low false positive rate, but a high true positive rate. Or you may want a high precision, but a low recall is okay, too.</p>
<p><strong>Choose your evaluation metrics in light of your desired tradeoffs.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since equal error costs are very rare in the real-world, the What-If Tool provides the ability to adjust the cost of misclassification as a criterion to help decide which threshold value to select. This ability, called the <em>Cost Ratio</em>, is defined as the relationship between the cost of a false positive and the cost of a false negative. Found in the Configure panel of the Performance &amp; Fairness, the Cost Ratio is required by the What-If Tool for binary classification models to optimize the classification thresholds when using the optimization strategy controls.</p>
<p>Changing the <em>Cost Ratio</em> affects classification thresholds and performance results. By default, the <em>Cost Ratio</em> is set to 1.0, at which false positives and false negatives are considered equally undesirable. As you increase the <em>Cost Ratio</em>, false positives produced by a model will be most costly than false negatives. Conversely, as you decrease the <em>Cost Ratio</em>, false negatives produced by a model will be more costly than false positives.</p>

</div>
<p>After adjusting the <em>Cost Ratio</em>, apply an optimization strategy in order for the What-If Tool to appropriately apply changes to the decision-making threshold. The ptimization strategy can be set in the Fairness panel, just below the Configure panel.</p>

</div>
<p>The consequences of models making errors may differ depending on their underlying context. Even within a model, each type of error may have a different consequence that can not be evaluated equally. While the What-If Tool does not have the metadata of every exact severity of any misclassified instance in, it does provide the ability to modify the <em>Cost Ratio</em> to help offset the often imbalance nature of error metrics, visualizing a wider range of uncertainty.</p>
